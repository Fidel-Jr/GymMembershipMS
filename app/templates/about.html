          <p class="lead">
            <strong>Gym Membership Management System</strong> is a web-based application designed to help gym administrators efficiently manage member records, membership plans, and payment information in one centralized platform.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            This system eliminates the need for manual record-keeping and paper-based files by providing a digital platform where all member data, payment information, and membership status are easily accessible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Members can register online, update their profiles, and view their membership details. 
          </p>
            With this system, gym admins can quickly assign memberships to new or existing users, track active and expired memberships, and record payments methods such as cash, credit card, or bank transfer. It also allows administrators to generate reports, view membership summaries, and ensure that renewals are handled on time.
